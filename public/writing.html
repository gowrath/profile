                                In my last post, I mentioned the importance of stories—or at least how paying attention
                                to the wrong metric might lead an organization astray.

                                As a former teacher, I constantly dealt with the common problem of executing lesson
                                plans in a way that increased student understanding and engaged everyone in the class. I
                                did have 150 students in my caseload, which made that difficult, but teachers are held
                                to impossible standards ipso facto. Good teachers can shift lessons on the fly, subtly
                                or substantially. To nix certain activities and to emphasize other ones. To pause in the
                                middle of lessons to delve into points and to ask students to confirm their
                                understanding.
                            </p>

                                In this vein, it is intellectually humbling when a lesson falls flat or you realize that
                                your perfectly designed lesson doesn’t perform as well in real-life. Whatever the
                                curriculum design, teachers know that how students receive the information is ultimately
                                the key differentiator in acquiring knowledge. Sometimes the best-designed/intentioned
                                lesson goes over students’ heads. At times, an activity that you spent 10 minutes
                                creating is a hit in class, providing a rich educational experience. This dichotomy
                                between theory and real-life performance is something that fascinates me.

                                How does this relate to metrics and recency bias? Recency bias—the excessive focus on
                                the most recent events or facts—pervades business thinking today. It’s a what did you do
                                for me lately attitude. What were your last quarter's sales? What’s your forecast? What
                                was your last valuation? And for good reason—investors are skeptical and will shift
                                capital to avoid opportunity cost and maximize return. Yet, the most successful
                                businesses today are those with long-term views. They are in every industry and have
                                consistent themes of business practices.

                                I want to merge the two ideas—the territory and map relation and recency bias. On a
                                practical level, what happens when the territory changes and the map does not? When the
                                underlying reality has changed but the metric has not? To take a step further, what if
                                the attempts to solve this problem discount historical events? If short-term fixes don’t
                                address the underlying problem (and world) that has changed underneath your feet?
                            </p>

                                I can only speak to my educational experience to answer these questions, but I think you
                                should constantly question your worldview and pursue the truth—honest, unfiltered, with
                                fidelity to the underlying history and present-day facts. Truth, or at least knowledge,
                                is social. It’s created between people who engage in purposeful knowledge creation.
                                Teachers stitch their maps of knowledge with their students, and people create quilts of
                                understanding, and that quilt gets melded into society as a whole.

                                As I work in instructional design, I’m constantly surrounded by similar problems I
                                encountered during my four years of teaching. One is addressing learning gaps. Another
                                is creating assessments based on what you actually teach.

                                I want to think through some of the standards and metrics that businesses measure. An
                                interesting point by Bezos stirred my thinking:

                                One great insight of this talk is a skeptical view of proxies–meaning that you are

                                (and ultimately reputational) business practice, and the second one focuses on how
                                adherence to a score such as customer satisfaction (like CSAT) can distort your

                                How does this relate to instructional design? At times, we read feedback that either
                                confirms that this is good learning (high NPS/CSAT scores), but we forget that the
                                learner experience is what we are trying to capture.

                                According to the Journal of Accounting Research, “an everyday example of surrogation is
                                a manager tasked with increasing customer satisfaction who begins to believe that the
                                customer satisfaction survey score actually is customer satisfaction.”

                                Teachers are very aware of this dynamic because we face it every single day. We assess
                                students—we figure out if they’re understanding, engaging, and writing cogently. But one
                                single writing assessment—or even a reading score such as SRI—is simply a measure of
                                reading skill. It is useful in so far as it actually diagnoses the gaps in learning. In
                                so far as what specific language skills that the student needs to focus on.

                                There are topics that students need—how to debug, for example. This is a crucial skill
                                that we are not teaching currently. And yet–it’s not being captured in our scores of
                                satisfaction. This metric isn’t evaluating the learner experience. Or in this case, the
                                developer experience.

                                And it’s here I’m humbled by my teaching experience because I realize that we are
                                accessing students on a skill (building an app) that requires other skills that we have
                                not explicitly taught them. (I am thinking about making a video on debugging to help
                                develop this skill.) But it pairs with the idea that you should always be on guard for
                                how that metric is accurately capturing reality.

                                As another example, I faced this when I administered standardized tests in my classroom,
                                and I was frustrated with regard to giving students a score without explaining what that
                                score meant, and why it was important (it wasn’t). The reality is that the learner
                                experience is paramount, in education and in corporate training. You cannot manage to
                                irrelevant metrics in a world that is changing by the day. Perhaps the SAT really does
                                skew to higher income folks who understand the word “equestrian” and specific cultural
                                references. Perhaps stock price shouldn’t be a proxy for business success. Perhaps
                                quarterly earnings shouldn’t be the most salient way that companies should be measured.
                                You get my point.

                                of the learning process. We need precise data. We need anecdotes. We need a skeptical
                                view of metrics. We actually need stories—ones in which blinding following a metric led
                                people astray.

                                These lessons will clarify our understanding of the world. We will teach exactly what
                                students need to know and their understanding will reflect our understanding. It will be
                                a 1:1; it will not require guesswork and individual troubleshooting.

                                This focus on learning objectives and teaching to them will, in my estimation, improve
                                the functioning of organizations today. We will clear up some of the sloppy thinking
                                that permeates business practice. We will start to see the world clearer and sweep away
                                some of the mysticism (what amounts to wishful thinking) around how to measure customer
                                satisfaction.

                                My thoughts around learning in the workplace has a lot to do with my teaching

                                This has been solidified this past year as I’ve become a student of data science and
